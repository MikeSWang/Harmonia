# To-Do List

Currently the Python package is published with basic API documentation and
unit tests.  Tutorials (notebooks integrated into documentation) that detail
an application pipeline will be added in the future; for now
[``application/``](../application/) offer basic scripts that demonstrate one
such application pipeline.


## Current agenda

- [ ] readme ([``README.md``](../README.md)): write basic introduction and
      instructions.
- [ ] build: add ``setup.py`` and ``requirements.txt``; employ Travis.


## Future extensions

- [ ] cosmology ([``cosmology``](../harmonia/cosmology/)): add bias,
      clustering and growth rate evolution and fiducial redshift-from-distance
      functions.
- [ ] unit tests ([``tests``](../harmonia/tests/)): more exhaustive unit
      testing.
